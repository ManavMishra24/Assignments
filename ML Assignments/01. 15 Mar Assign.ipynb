    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human-level intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, and decision-making. AI can be divided into two main categories: Narrow or Weak AI and General or Strong AI. Narrow AI refers to systems that are designed to perform specific tasks, while General AI refers to systems that can perform any intellectual task that a human can.\n",

Unsupervised learning is used for clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction.\n",

    "Training Set: The training set is the portion of the data used to train the model. The model is trained on this data and learns the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. The goal of the training set is to help the model learn to make accurate predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation Set: The validation set is a portion of the data that is used to evaluate the performance of the model during training. The validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too complex and starts to memorize the training data instead of learning the underlying patterns. The validation set helps to identify when the model is starting to overfit and allows us to make adjustments to prevent it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Set: The test set is a portion of the data that is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. The test set is used to measure the accuracy of the model on new, unseen data. The goal of the test set is to ensure that the model is generalizing well and not just performing well on the data it was trained on.\n",

    "The importance of these terms lies in the fact that they help us develop and evaluate machine learning models that generalize well to new, unseen data. Without a validation set, we would not be able to detect overfitting, and without a test set, we would not be able to measure the true performance of the model on new data. The training set is used to train the model and ensure that it can learn the underlying patterns in the data. By splitting the data into these three sets, we can develop machine learning models that are more accurate, reliable, and effective in real-world applications."
